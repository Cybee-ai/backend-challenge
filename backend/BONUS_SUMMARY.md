# Google Workspace Integration - Bonus Features

As Mohammad Hamarsheh, I've implemented the following bonus features for the Google Workspace Integration project.

## Bonus 1: Cloud Deployment

I've implemented comprehensive cloud deployment capabilities for Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

### Production-Ready Docker Configuration
- Created a `Dockerfile.production` with multi-stage builds for optimized container images
- Implemented proper security practices (non-root user, minimal dependencies)
- Added health checks for container monitoring

### Cloud Build Integration
- Added `cloudbuild.yaml` for automated CI/CD pipelines
- Configured automatic deployment to Cloud Run or GKE
- Set up secret management for sensitive data

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Created Kubernetes manifests in the `kubernetes/` directory:
  - `deployment.yaml` for application deployment with proper resource limits
  - `service.yaml` for service discovery
  - `ingress.yaml` for external access
  - `secrets.yaml` template for secure credential management

### Deployment Documentation
- Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step instructions
- Provided options for both serverless (Cloud Run) and container orchestration (GKE) deployments
- Added troubleshooting and security best practices

## Bonus 2: Monitoring with Elasticsearch

I've implemented a robust monitoring system using Elasticsearch:

### Elasticsearch Integration
- Added an Elasticsearch plugin for Fastify
- Configured automatic index creation for metrics
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for when Elasticsearch is unavailable

### Comprehensive Metrics Collection
- **API Metrics**: Request rates, response times, and status codes
- **Log Processing Metrics**: Fetch and forward rates, success/failure counts
- **System Metrics**: Memory usage, CPU usage, and uptime
- **Source Metrics**: Active sources and source operations

### Metrics Service
- Created a dedicated `MetricsService` for centralized metrics collection
- Integrated metrics collection into all key services:
  - `LogFetcherService`
  - `LogForwarderService`
  - `SourceController`
- Added API request tracking middleware

### Kibana Dashboard
- Provided a pre-configured Kibana dashboard in `elasticsearch/kibana-dashboard.ndjson`
- Created visualizations for all key metrics
- Added documentation for dashboard setup and customization

## How to Use

### Monitoring
1. Access Kibana at http://localhost:5601
2. Import the dashboard from `elasticsearch/kibana-dashboard.ndjson`
3. View real-time metrics for the application

### Cloud Deployment
1. Follow my instructions in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Choose between Cloud Run (serverless) or GKE (Kubernetes) deployment
3. Use the provided configuration files for automated deployment

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to add:

### Monitoring
- Alerting based on metric thresholds
- Log retention policies
- More detailed system metrics

### Cloud Deployment
- Terraform configuration for infrastructure as code
- Blue/green deployment strategies
- Autoscaling based on metrics
